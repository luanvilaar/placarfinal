## What is AIOX Squads?

# The community repository for AIOX squads

**If an AI agent is an _employee_, a Squad is an entire _department_.**

This is the official community repository for sharing, discovering, and contributing squads for the [AIOX](https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core) framework. Squads are self-contained packages of specialized AI agents — with Voice DNA, decision heuristics, and quality gates — that any AIOX user can install, use, and share.

**Find squads. Share squads. Build together.**

|        | Step                | Example                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **01** | Browse the catalog  | _"I need elite copywriting."_                                       |
| **02** | Install it          | `*download-squad copy` — one command inside AIOX.                   |
| **03** | Activate the chief  | `@copy-chief` — the orchestrator routes your work to the right specialist. |
| **04** | Contribute back     | Built a squad? Open a PR and share it with the community.           |

<br/>

> **AIOX (the framework) lives at [aiox-core](https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core).** This repository is where the community publishes and discovers squads — like npm is for Node.js packages.

## This repository is for you if

- ✅ You use **[AIOX](https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core)** and want **ready-made squads** to install in your project
- ✅ You need **domain-specific knowledge** — copywriting, security, data, branding — not generic responses
- ✅ You want agents that **think like real experts**, with cloned frameworks and heuristics
- ✅ You **built a squad** and want to share it with the community
- ✅ You want to **learn** how squads are built and get inspired by existing examples
- ✅ You want to **compose multiple squads** — copy + brand + data — on the same project

<br/>

## What is a Squad?

A squad is a self-contained package of AI agents that work together in a domain. Not loose prompts — full systems:

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center" width="33%">
<h3>🧬 Expert Cloning</h3>
Agents carry Voice DNA and Thinking DNA from real specialists. Not generic prompts — real frameworks.
</td>
<td align="center" width="33%">
<h3>📦 Drop-in Ready</h3>
Install with <code>*download-squad</code> or copy the folder. Each squad is fully self-contained — agents, tasks, templates, data.
</td>
<td align="center" width="33%">
<h3>🏗️ Tier Architecture</h3>
Chief routes → Masters execute → Specialists assist → Support validates. Clear chain of command.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
<h3>✅ Quality Gates</h3>
Every squad is scored and validated. 4-tier quality system ensures agents actually deliver.
</td>
<td align="center">
<h3>🔀 Composable</h3>
Mix squads freely. Run copy + brand + data on the same project. They know how to hand off.
</td>
<td align="center">
<h3>🎯 Deterministic</h3>
Heuristics with IF/THEN rules and veto conditions. Agents follow proven playbooks, not vibes.

</tr>
</table>

<br/>

## Quickstart

### Prerequisite

Squads run on the [AIOX](https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core) framework. If you don't have it yet:

```bash
npx aios-core init my-project
```

### Install a Squad from this repository

```bash
# Option 1: Via AIOX CLI (recommended)
@squad-chief
*download-squad copy

# Option 2: Manual
git clone https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-squads.git
cp -r aiox-squads/squads/copy ./squads/copy
```

### Use it

```bash
# Activate the squad's chief
@copy-chief

# See available commands
*help

# Run a task
*create-sales-page
```

> **Compatible with:** Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor — any IDE supported by [AIOX](https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core).

### Squad Creator: Free vs Pro

AIOX ships with the **Squad Creator Free** — 1 agent, 24 tasks, template-driven creation. For those who need more, there's the **Squad Creator Pro**: mind cloning, model routing, 3 specialist agents, and axioma assessment.

See the [full comparison](../squads/squad-creator-pro/).

<br/>

## How Squads Work

### The Tier System

Every squad follows a clear chain of command:

```
  Tier 0 — Chief (Orchestrator)
  ├── Receives mission, classifies intent, routes to the right specialist.
  │
  ├── Tier 1 — Masters
  │   Primary specialists. Execute the core domain missions.
  │
  ├── Tier 2 — Specialists
  │   Niche experts. Called by Tier 1 for specific sub-tasks.
  │
  └── Tier 3 — Support
      Shared utilities. Quality gates, templates, analytics.
```

### Agent Anatomy (6 Layers)

Every agent is a structured `.md` file with:

```yaml
agent:       # Identity — name, id, tier
persona:     # Role and communication style
voice_dna:   # Cloned vocabulary, sentence patterns, anti-patterns
heuristics:  # IF/THEN decision rules with veto conditions
examples:    # Concrete input/output pairs (min. 3)
handoffs:    # When to stop and delegate to another agent
```

### Maturity Levels

Squads in this repository go through validation and earn maturity badges:

| Level | Criteria | Badge |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **DRAFT** | Basic structure, score < 7.0 | 🔴 |
| **DEVELOPING** | Score ≥ 7.0, functional agents, executable tasks | 🟡 |
| **OPERATIONAL** | Score ≥ 9.0, tested in production, proven real-world usage | 🟢 |

## FAQ

**Is this AIOX?**
No. The AIOX framework lives at [aiox-core](https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core). This repository is where the community shares squads — like npm is for Node.js packages.

**Do I need AIOX to use squads?**
Yes. Squads are packages that run on the [AIOX](https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core) framework. Install with `npx aios-core init`.

**Do I need all the squads?**
No. Each squad is self-contained. Install only what you need.

**Does it only work on Claude Code?**
No. AIOX supports Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and Cursor. Compatibility varies by IDE — Claude Code has full support.

**Can I use it in commercial projects?**
Yes. MIT license.

**How do I update a squad?**
Run `*download-squad {name}` again or replace the folder manually. Each squad's `CHANGELOG.md` documents breaking changes.

**How do I contribute a squad?**
Fork, create your squad, validate with `*validate-squad`, open a PR. See the [Contributing](#contributing) section.

**What's Voice DNA?**
It's how we clone expert communication style. Sentence starters, vocabulary rules, anti-patterns — so agents don't just know what to say, they know *how* to say it like the real expert would.
